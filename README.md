# üèõÔ∏è [Protocol Name] - Decentralized RWA Lending Protocol

**[Protocol Name]** is an innovative decentralized lending protocol that bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) by utilizing **Real World Assets (RWAs)** as collateral. This repository contains all components of the protocol: the **Smart Contracts** that power the core logic and the **Frontend** web application for user interaction.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The project is structured into two main directories:

| Directory | Contents | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `smart-contracts/` | Solidity files, deployment scripts, and tests. | The core, audited logic for the RWA-based lending platform. |
| `frontend/website/` | React/Next.js/Vue files, public assets, and styling. | The user-facing web interface for interacting with the protocol. |

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **RWA-Backed Loans:** Secure loans using a diversified basket of tokenized real-world assets.
* **Transparent Oracles:** Utilizes reliable, decentralized oracle networks (e.g., Chainlink) for accurate, real-time RWA valuation.
* **Intuitive UI:** A user-friendly interface in `frontend/website/` for easy lending, borrowing, and collateral management.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Overall)

This section details the prerequisites for setting up both the smart contracts and the frontend, and how to run the entire stack locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** We recommend using the LTS version ([Check Node.js website for the latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/)).
* **Yarn** or **npm:** A package manager (we'll use `npm`).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **[Specific Prerequisite for Contracts, e.g., Foundry or Hardhat CLI]:** Necessary for contract compilation/testing.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-Username]/[Protocol-Name].git
    cd [Protocol-Name]
    ```

2.  **Install Global Dependencies**
    Since this is a monorepo, you may have some root dependencies, though the main installation steps are within the sub-directories.

    ```bash
    # Install any root-level dependencies if applicable
    npm install
    ```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Smart Contracts (`smart-contracts/`)

This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts, deployment scripts, and testing suites.

### Installation and Setup (Contracts)

1.  **Navigate to the Contract Directory**
    ```bash
    cd smart-contracts
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies (If separate)**
    ```bash
    # If the contracts have their own package.json
    npm install
    # OR if using Foundry/non-Node environment, ensure dependencies are fetched
    # forge install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file within the **`smart-contracts/`** directory (or use a root `.env` if preferred) for deployment keys and network URLs.

    ```env
    # Example for Hardhat/Foundry
    RPC_URL_TESTNET=[https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/](https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/)[YOUR_KEY]
    PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=[YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY]
    ```

### Running the Contracts

1.  **Compile Contracts**
    ```bash
    # Example for Hardhat/Foundry
    npx hardhat compile
    # OR forge build
    ```
2.  **Run Tests**
    ```bash
    # Example for Hardhat/Foundry
    npx hardhat test
    # OR forge test
    ```
3.  **Deploy to Testnet (e.g., Sepolia)**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
    ```

---

## üåê Frontend Application (`frontend/website/`)

This directory contains the web application used by users to interact with the deployed smart contracts.

### Installation and Setup (Frontend)

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/website
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file within the **`frontend/website/`** directory. This configuration is for the web application's connection to the blockchain.

    ```env
    # Example for React App
    REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=[DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
    REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID=[NETWORK_ID_OF_DEPLOYMENT]
    # Required for API calls (e.g., from an Infura/Alchemy node)
    REACT_APP_RPC_URL=[https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/](https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/)[YOUR_KEY]
    ```

### Running the Frontend

1.  **Start the Local Development Server**
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR npm start
    ```

2.  **View the Application**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the displayed local address (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
